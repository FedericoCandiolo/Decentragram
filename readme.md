#### This project is based on the `Decentragram tutorial` by `DAPP University`

# Project
Images are uploaded through a decentralized repo. Then, its hashes are uploaded to the blockchain.
Instead of receiving likes, the images can be tipped with ETH.
The browser needs to be a blockchain browser. To make a chrome based browser a blockchain browser, I reccomend using MetaMask. 
Web3 allows the app to consume and write to the blockchain.

# Technologies used
 - Node JS + Express JS (Back End)
 - HTML + CSS + Bootstrap + React JS (Front End)
 - Solidity (Creation of smart contracts)
 - Truffle (Node JS Package for compliling and migrating smart contracts)
 - Ganashe (For dev blockchain, part of the truffle suit)
 - Chai (For testing, part of the truffle suit)
 - Web3 (Package to interact with blockchain from browser)
 - MetaMask (Browser extension to turn regular browsers into blockchain browser)
 - IPFS (To upload the images to a decentralized repo)

# Getting things to work
## Ganashe
It is necessary to install Ganashe and run it while using the app.

## MetaMask
You can look at the extension at any chrome based browser or at firefox browser.


# Deploy

## NPM: Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
